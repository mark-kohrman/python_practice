#CONDITIONALS
#### 1
# Use the first half of Peter Jang notation (line numbers only) to keep track of which lines of code get run.

# bertha = 3      # 1
# if bertha > 5:  # 2
#   print(bertha)      
#   print(bertha - 3)  
            
# print(bertha)   #3  

# if bertha > 1:  #4  
#   print(bertha - 2) #4
#   print(bertha - 3)  #5
         
# print(bertha)   #7

#### 2
# Fix the condition in the code below such that it will print 100.

# maria = 19
# if maria < 20:
#     print(100)

#### 3

# WRITE: Write code to store the ages of four different people using four separate variables. Then print out any of the ages that are greater than 18 (using if conditions).

# joe = 19
# tammy = 54
# lisa = 14
# stevo = 99

# if joe > 18:
#     print(joe)

# if tammy > 18:
#     print(tammy)

# if lisa > 18:
#     print(lisa)

# if stevo > 18:
#     print(stevo)
#### 4
# DEBUG: The following code runs without errors. However, the output is incorrect due to a mistake in the code. Run the code to see the output, then find and fix the mistake in the code. Explain in your own words why the original code ran without error messages.

# x = 20
# if x < 10:
#   x = x + 1

# if x == 10:
#   x = x + 2

# if x > 10:
#   x = x + 3

# print(x)

####5 
# There are two mistakes with the code below. One mistake will cause the code to crash. The other mistake doesnâ€™t cause the code to crash, but it is unnecessary code. Fix both mistakes.


# x = 10
# if x < 5:
#   print(0) 
# elif x < 100:
#   print(2) 

#### 6
# abc = 30      
# if abc > 45:   
#   print(1)         
#   if abc > 25:
#     print(2) 

# abc = 30      
# if abc > 45:  
#   print(1)

# if abc > 25: 
#   print(2)         

####7    

# bob = 30
# if bob > 10:
#   print(0)
# else:
#   print(1)

####8 

# WRITE: Use variables to store the ages of three different people. If all three people are older than 18, print 0. Otherwise, print 1.

# jeff = 33
# ana = 89
# joe = 18.5

# if (jeff > 18) and (ana > 18) and (joe > 18):
#     print(0)
# else:
#     print(1)

# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.
x = 99
if x == 10:
  print(0)
else:
  print(-1)

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.

# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.

# 7. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.

# 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.

# 9. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.

# 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).
y = 44

if y > 80:
  print(5)
elif y > 60:
  print(4)
elif y > 40:
  print(3)
elif y > 20:
  print(2)
else:
  print(1)
