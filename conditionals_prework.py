#CONDITIONALS
#### 1
# Use the first half of Peter Jang notation (line numbers only) to keep track of which lines of code get run.

# bertha = 3      # 1
# if bertha > 5:  # 2
#   print(bertha)      
#   print(bertha - 3)  
            
# print(bertha)   #3  

# if bertha > 1:  #4  
#   print(bertha - 2) #4
#   print(bertha - 3)  #5
         
# print(bertha)   #7

#### 2
# Fix the condition in the code below such that it will print 100.

# maria = 19
# if maria < 20:
#     print(100)

#### 3

# WRITE: Write code to store the ages of four different people using four separate variables. Then print out any of the ages that are greater than 18 (using if conditions).

# joe = 19
# tammy = 54
# lisa = 14
# stevo = 99

# if joe > 18:
#     print(joe)

# if tammy > 18:
#     print(tammy)

# if lisa > 18:
#     print(lisa)

# if stevo > 18:
#     print(stevo)
#### 4
# DEBUG: The following code runs without errors. However, the output is incorrect due to a mistake in the code. Run the code to see the output, then find and fix the mistake in the code. Explain in your own words why the original code ran without error messages.

# x = 20
# if x < 10:
#   x = x + 1

# if x == 10:
#   x = x + 2

# if x > 10:
#   x = x + 3

# print(x)

####5 
# There are two mistakes with the code below. One mistake will cause the code to crash. The other mistake doesnâ€™t cause the code to crash, but it is unnecessary code. Fix both mistakes.


# x = 10
# if x < 5:
#   print(0) 
# elif x < 100:
#   print(2) 

#### 6
# abc = 30      
# if abc > 45:   
#   print(1)         
#   if abc > 25:
#     print(2) 

# abc = 30      
# if abc > 45:  
#   print(1)

# if abc > 25: 
#   print(2)         

####7    

# bob = 30
# if bob > 10:
#   print(0)
# else:
#   print(1)

####8 

# WRITE: Use variables to store the ages of three different people. If all three people are older than 18, print 0. Otherwise, print 1.

jeff = 33
ana = 89
joe = 18.5

if (jeff > 18) and (ana > 18) and (joe > 18):
    print(0)
else:
    print(1)
