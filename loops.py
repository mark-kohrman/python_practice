# WRITE: Write a program using a loop that prints out the entire exact lyrics of the famous song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". You can find the lyrics here.

# Write the code to print out all numbers from 200 to 300 with a for loop. Then write the code to print out all numbers from 200 to 300 with a while loop instead.

#   print(x)
# x = 200
# while x < 301:
#   print(x)
#   x += 1

# The following code will run 100 times, and each time it will ask the user for their name. The code will break early if the userâ€™s name is Bob.

# 100.times do

#   name = gets.chomp
#   if name == "Bob"
#     break
#   end

# Rewrite the code using a while loop so the program will run *forever* unless the user enters a name of Bob.

# while True:
#   print("Please enter your name:")
#   name = input()

# WRITE: Use a .times loop to print the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, etc., all the way up to 100. Then write code to produce the same result using a while loop instead.

# Fibonacci numbers are numbers that follow the pattern: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.

# That is, each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it.

# Write a program that prints out the first 100 fibonacci numbers. Use a loop!

# Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. After the user is done, the program will tell the user which word was entered the most frequently.

# For example, if the user enters:

# apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear

# The program will say:

# apple was your most common word
# (That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)

# HINT: USE A HASH TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY TIMES EACH WORD APPEARS IN THE LIST.
