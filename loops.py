# WRITE: Write a program using a loop that prints out the entire exact lyrics of the famous song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". You can find the lyrics here.
####ANSWER
# bottles = 100
# while bottles > 1:
#   bottles -=1
#   if bottles > 2:
#     print(f"{bottles} bottles of beer on the wall, {bottles} bottles of beer.")
#     print(f"Take one down pass it around {bottles - 1} bottles of beer on the wall")
#   elif bottles == 2:
#     print(f"{bottles} bottles of beer on the wall, {bottles} bottles of beer.")
#     print(f"Take one down pass it around {bottles - 1} bottle of beer on the wall")
#   else:
#     print(f"{bottles} bottle of beer on the wall, {bottles} bottle of beer.")
#     print(f"Take one down pass it around no more bottles of beer on the wall")

#     print(f"No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.")
#     print(f"Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall")

# Write the code to print out all numbers from 200 to 300 with a for loop. Then write the code to print out all numbers from 200 to 300 with a while loop instead.

# for x in range(200, 301):
#   print(x)
# x = 200
# while x < 301:
#   print(x)
#   x += 1

# The following code will run 100 times, and each time it will ask the user for their name. The code will break early if the userâ€™s name is Bob.

# 100.times do
#   puts "What is your name?"  
#   name = gets.chomp
#   if name == "Bob"
#     break
#   end
# end

# puts "Hi, Bob!"
# Rewrite the code using a while loop so the program will run *forever* unless the user enters a name of Bob.

# while True:
#   print("Please enter your name:")
#   name = input()
#   if name == "Bob":
#     break


# print("Hi Bob")

# ######The following code is supposed to print the numbers 1 to 10, but it currently doesn't work. Find the mistake and fix the code.
# for x in range(1, 11):
#   print(x)
#   x = x + 1


######
# WRITE: Use a .times loop to print the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, etc., all the way up to 100. Then write code to produce the same result using a while loop instead.

# for x in range(5, 101, 5):
#   print(x)

# x = 5
# while x < 101:
#   print(x)
#   x += 5


# puts "This code should output the following sequence: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, BLASTOFF!"
# x = 10
# while x < 1
#   p x
#   x = x - 1
#   puts "BLASTOFF!"
# end

# x = 10
# while x > 0:
#   print(x)
#   x = x - 1

# print("BLASTOFF!")
