# Write code to produce the following output. Note that there are many valid solutions - for this exercise, you are required to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at least once.
# 4
# 30
# 12
# 983

# print(5 - 1)
# print(24+6)
# print(6 * 2)
# print(2949 / 3)

# Start with this line of code:
# p 100 * 5 - 2 / 2
# If you run the code, it will output 499. Just by adding parentheses, change the output to 150. DO NOT change any numbers or operators (*, -, / etc.)

# print(100 * (5 - 2) / 2)

# DEBUG: The code below has errors. Run the code to identify the line which causes an error, then fix each error one line at a time. For this exercise, do not make changes to any lines that run without error.
