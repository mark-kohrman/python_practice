# Write code to produce the following output. Note that there are many valid solutions - for this exercise, you are required to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at least once.
# 4
# 30
# 12
# 983

# print(5 - 1)
# print(24+6)
# print(6 * 2)
# print(2949 / 3)

# Start with this line of code:
# p 100 * 5 - 2 / 2
# If you run the code, it will output 499. Just by adding parentheses, change the output to 150. DO NOT change any numbers or operators (*, -, / etc.)

# print(100 * (5 - 2) / 2)

# DEBUG: The code below has errors. Run the code to identify the line which causes an error, then fix each error one line at a time. For this exercise, do not make changes to any lines that run without error.

# print(1 + 1)
# print(2 * 3)
# print(9 / 3.0)
# print(8 + .2 - 3)
# print(9+4-9)
# print(9+2-2)
# print(7+3-4)
# print(8-3*2)
# print(7 + 10)
# print(4 / 4 + 4)

#VARIABLES

# In Python, you can use any combination of upper and lower case letters to make a variable name. Most special characters arenâ€™t allowed, but there are a few exceptions. If you run the code below, it will crash due to invalid variable names. Find the invalid variable names and delete the special characters (be sure to leave the special characters in the valid variable names alone).
# bob7 = 50
# bob = 50
# bobat = 50
# atbob = 50
# bob_ = 50
# _bob = 50
# bobdollar = 50
# dollarbob = 50
# print(dollarbob)

# In this code, the variable z is printed out on lines 4 and 6. Predict what will print out to the terminal, then run the code to see if you were right. Explain in your own words exactly why those values were printed to the terminal.

# x = 40
# y = 3
# z = x + y
# print(z)
# x = 60
# print(z)

# A family wants to order 2 hamburgers without bacon, 3 cheeseburgers with bacon and 5 golden fries. Use Python code to model this situation with variables and compute the total cost of their order (not including tax).
# hamburger = 8.95
# cheeseburger = 9.95
# add_bacon = 2
# golden_fries = 2.95

# total = (hamburger * 2) + ((cheeseburger + add_bacon) * 3) + (golden_fries * 5)
# print(total)

# DEBUG: Fix the code found below.

# 3 = x
# 9 = y
# p x + y
#ANSWER
x = 3
y = 9

# print(x + y)
